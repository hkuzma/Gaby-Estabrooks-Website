My name is Gaby Estabrooks and I am a 2025
film studies and studio art graduate from University of Vermont. I’m a very driven person and love doing work across all different areas of the arts- production design, screenwriting, sketch and stand up comedy, directing, acting, graphic design, and lighting.

I’ve been passionate about filmmaking- especially comedy- from the time I picked up a digital camera when I was 9 years old and discovered it had a video mode. From that point on, I used to make my friends be in parody commercials and short movies until I went to college and met people who liked the same things I did.

I was the president of both Art Club and our Sketch Comedy group Cheese Shtick during my time at UVM. Once I graduated, I started courses with IDC Professionals to become a certified Intimacy Director and Coordinator and couldn’t be more excited!
